Ah, the 70's, a time of love, rock and roll, and the emergence of the microprocessor. At that time, a young upstart company by the name of Intel was doing a contracting job to keep the lights on, and they created an interesting little chip: the Intel 4004. Today, we've mostly forgotten that cute little CPU's legacy, so it might be good for us all to have a little reminder about how innovative it was!
